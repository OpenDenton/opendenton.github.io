The Denton Innovation Lab Is a partnership between public, private, and individuals to design and pilot smart city initiatives and applications to build a more prosperous City of Denton.

- Pilot a network of environmental sensors 
- Apply Open Data portal improvements plan 
- Applying for Traffic data sharing grant 

#### Phase Two: 
- Pilot linking 311 system, mobile reporting system 
- Autonomous vehicle testing 
- Unified user account for all city related systems 
- Smart screens with charging station
- Adding citizen review system for city services
- Intern program with council or in general with city operation


While this is a new adventure for the community, it's not something we want to do alone. We would love to have participation and partners that represent various parts of the community. If you're part of one of these organizations, contact us! We'd love to chat.
