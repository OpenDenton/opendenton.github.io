DFW Open Data Day on March 2nd 2019 at the Dallas Main Public Library, in collaboration with [International Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/), the [City of Dallas](https://dallascityhall.com/Pages/default.aspx), the [City of Denton](https://www.cityofdenton.com/), the [City of Addison](https://addisontexas.net/), [BloomReach](https://www.bloomreach.com), [Rogue Metrics](https://www.roguemetrics.com), the [UNT Libraries](https://library.unt.edu/) and [TechMill](https://techmill.co/).

#### Schedule
8:30 AM to 5 PM at [The J. Erik Jonsson Central Library](http://dallaslibrary2.org/central/index.php), on March 2nd.

#### What?
Open Data Day is a gathering of tech volunteers in DFW to write applications, liberate data, create visualizations and publish analyses using public municipal data to show support for and encourage the adoption of open data policies across the region. It is a good chance for students and local developers to use public data to produce something useful for their community.

#### Who is invited?
If you have an idea for using open data or you want to find an interesting project to contribute towards, then definitely come participate!

- We need developers in Python, GIS, Databases (especially cloud-based services), and Data Analytics / Statistics.
- **Designers**
- We need people like you to make everything look amazing, feel intuitive, and have a smooth user experience.
- **Technical Writers**
- We need writers who like to polish the final data and contribute to reports for municipal elected officials and the general public.
